# Marketing Campaign A/B Testing Analysis in Excel

## üßæ **Introduction**
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of two distinct marketing campaigns, a Control Campaign and a Test Campaign, both conducted during the period from **August 1** to **August 30**.

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign based on multiple performance metrics such as **spending, impressions, website clicks, searches, content views, add-to-cart actions, and purchases**.

A/B Testing was used as the primary framework for comparison. This technique allows marketers and analysts to assess whether the observed differences between two campaign strategies are **statistically significant** or simply the result of random variation.

By combining **descriptive analysis** with **statistical testing**, this project aims to identify which campaign achieved better results and provide insights that can guide future marketing decisions.

## üéØ **Objective**
The main objective of this project is to **compare the performance** of the two marketing campaigns, Control and Test, to determine which one delivered better results during the campaign period.

Specifically, the analysis seeks to:

* Evaluate key performance metrics such as **Amount Spent, Impressions, Reach, Website Clicks, Searches, Content Views, Add to Cart, and Purchases**.

* Identify whether the observed differences between the two campaigns are **statistically significant** using hypothesis testing (T-test).

* Provide **data-driven insights** that can support marketing strategy optimization and improve future campaign performance.

Through this analysis, the project demonstrates how A/B testing can be used to guide **evidence-based decision-making** in digital marketing.

## üìä **Dataset Description**
* **Data Source**: The dataset was synthetically generated to simulate real-world digital marketing performance data for two e-commerce campaigns.

* **Time Period**: From **August 1st** to **August 30th**, covering **30 days** of campaign performance.

* **Columns Description**:
    * `Campaign Name`: Identifier of the marketing campaign (Test Campaign
     or Control Campaign).

    * `Date`: The specific day of observation.

    * `Spend (USD)`: Total daily advertising spend in USD.

    * `# of Impressions`: Number of times the ad was displayed to users.

    * `Reach`: Number of unique users who saw the ad.

    * `# of Website Clicks`: Number of times users clicked the ad and visited the website.

    * `# of Searches`: Number of searches made by users after clicking the ad.

    * `# of View Content`: Number of times users viewed product details or content.

    * `# of Add to Cart`: Number of users who added products to their cart.

    * `# of Purchase`: Number of completed purchases resulting from the campaign.

* **Dataset Size**:
    <br>**60** records in total (**30 days** for each campaign).
* **Notes**:
    * Some missing values and outliers were intentionally added to simulate real-world data imperfections.

    * Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Power Query to ensure data quality before analysis.

## üßπ**Data Cleaning**
Before conducting any statistical analysis, the dataset was carefully cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.

* **Outlier Treatment**:
<br>Outliers were identified using **Z-scores** and visually confirmed with **box plots**.
Any value with a Z-score outside the range of **-3 to +3** was considered a potential outlier.
In the control dataset, one outlier was detected in the **# of Searches** column and replaced with the **median** value.
<br>After correction, all variables were found to be within the acceptable range, indicating no remaining outliers.

* **Handling Missing Values**:
<br>Missing values were replaced with the **mean** of each column after verifying data consistency.
This approach helped maintain the overall statistical balance without introducing bias.

* **Data Type Verification**:
<br>Each column‚Äôs data type was reviewed to ensure compatibility with further analysis.<br>
    
    * **Numeric columns** were properly formatted for statistical tests.

    * **Date columns** were converted to the correct date format.

    * **Categorical fields** such as Campaign Name were standardized.

## **üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The goal of this step was to gain a clear understanding of both marketing campaigns (Control and Test groups) before conducting any hypothesis testing.

### **5.1 Descriptive Statistics**
Descriptive statistics were generated for all numerical variables, including:
**Spend (USD), # of Impressions, Reach, # of Website Clicks, # of Searches, # of View Content, # of Add to Cart, and # of Purchase**.

These tables summarize the **mean, median, standard deviation, variance, minimum, and maximum** values for each campaign.

They provide a quick overview of how the performance metrics differ between the two groups.
