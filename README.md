# Marketing Campaign A/B Testing Analysis in Excel

## ðŸ§­ Project Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of two marketing campaigns through A/B testing using Microsoft Excel.
The primary objective is to evaluate whether the test campaign achieved better performance outcomes compared to the control campaign, based on key marketing metrics such as Amount Spent, Impressions, Reach, Website Clicks, Searches, Content Views, Add to Cart actions, and Purchases.

The dataset covers both campaigns over a consistent period â€” from August 1 to August 30 â€” allowing for a fair comparison under similar conditions.
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and statistical testing (t-test), this project aims to identify significant differences in campaign performance and derive insights that can guide future marketing decisions.

# ðŸŽ¯ Key Goals
- Perform data cleaning and ensure consistency across both datasets.

-  Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand trends, distribution, and potential outliers.

-  Apply statistical testing (t-test) to measure whether observed performance differences are statistically significant.

- Present findings clearly and visually using Excel charts and descriptive summaries.

# ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified missing values, handled data types, detected outliers using Z-scores, and summarized numerical distributions.

- **Data Cleaning**: Used Power Query to transform, split, and format raw campaign data into structured, analysis-ready tables.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied T-tests to compare performance metrics between control and test campaigns and evaluate statistical significance.

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Calculated key metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance) to describe campaign performance.

- **Data Visualization**: Created box plots and summary charts to visualize patterns, detect anomalies, and present findings clearly.

- **Analytical Interpretation**: Drew insights from quantitative results to support data-driven marketing decisions.
